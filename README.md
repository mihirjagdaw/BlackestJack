The goal of this project is to first create a blackjack game. 
Then to implement a teaching mechanic to teach the user how to play "perfect" blackjack in a game-y way.
Thirdly, to create an endless mode of blackkack to see how far you can get before losing it all. This is to also hopefully teach myself and the user responsible gambling - get out while you're up.

Ultimately, create a 3D game based off a night out with some friends. It will include unique npcs from the night out. Funny dialogue and a unique art style.
(hopefully)
